* When was the company incorporated?

    Allvue Systems was incorporated in September 2019.

* Who are the founders of the company?

    Allvue Systems is the resulting company of a merger of two SAAS portfolio companies owned by Vista Equity Partners, a prominent private equity firm in the space.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    Vista Equity Partners executed the merger of Black Mountain Systems and AltaReturn in order to offer a robust array of front office software suites for clients ranging from banks and custodians all the way down to smaller insurance companies and family offices.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Allvue in it's current operating form is funded by a bit more than $200mm in debt that is backed by the parent company, Vista Partners and roughly $600mm in common stock, 85% of which is owned by Vista Partners as well. 


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    Streamlining of data from the front office and sales spectrum of businesses all the way down to accounting and tax liability is the primary objective.  This is instrumental in making day to day business activities more efficient. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

    Allvue serves the interests of General Partners, Fund Administrators, Banks, Insurance Companies, Family Offices, Real Estate, Private Debt, CLO Managers, Venture Capital, Fund of Funds & Asset Managers.  They currently have $2.5T in assets under management on their platforms.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    They offer a proven suite of software and services top to bottom to the widest array of financial managers, with bespoke elements being developed for each client along the way.  They do not treat is as a "one size fits all" issue, instead thoroughly understanding their clients needs and wants and providing everything that makes sense within their development capabilities, which are vast.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

    Per Crunchbase, active products include HTML5, jQuery and Google Analytics.  Active technologies include Viewport Meta, Iphone/Mobile Compatible & Domain Not Resolving.  There are others listed behind a paywall a $79 a month subscription.  Apvue confirmed much of this as well, but the same paywall issue is present.


## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Investment Management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?

    Most innovations in the last 5-10 years in the Investment Management space have been driven by eliminating manual and time consuming processes for portfolio analytics and trade processing all the way down to fund accounting.  Also, greater industry regulation has required a focus on compliance and investor/regulator transparency.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    Major competitors in the space are Carta, Juniper Square, Irwin, Backstop Solutions Suite, Nitrogen, Affinity, Pershing Financial Services, Astrella, HiddenLevers & Ledgy


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    Allvue's scale of reaching $2.5T of AUM on it's platforms has an inexorable effect on the space.  All of their users have a unique power over their data and operations, making them more efficient top to bottom and requiring less headcount to achieve the same results.  What has resulted is a sleeker, more compliant version of what the business was a decade or more ago.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    Revenue is obviously the primary metric by which all businesses in this space are measured.  Other important metrics are customer retention & satisfaction in order to continue to grow the AUM present on your platoform.  In terms of revenue, there is room for improvement.  Their indebtedness to the parent company and ability to reduce debt service payments in the short term will be instrumental in how much revenue numbers can continue to grow.  All customer metrics seem to be firmly in place with AUM growing and few to none scheduled to depart their respective platforms in use.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    Revenue numbers are increasing with each quarter reported, and there is no expectation of that going down in the near term.  It's difficult to gauge financial performance as many similar companies are owned by larger banks and organizations, therefore published revenue line items for those businesses are not opaque in nature.  The AUM on the platform suggests a robust picture for subscription and development fees in quarters moving forward.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    I am currently discussing with the company a role that will focus on public credit and CLO management functions on their platforms.  They want to increase their customer base across these growing markets and offer a more robust suite of services across the board.  Trust and custody services need to be addressed as well as credit agreement analytics that can be deployed as a product management parameter for clients.  To me, the next obvous horizon for Allvue to explore, especially now during a time of a bit of upheaval, is to offer platform services specific to commercial and residential real estate investors and developers.  That is a largely untapped market with enormous potential. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    Everything listed above benefits the company by increasing the broader business footprint, thus increasing AUMs on the various platforms.  This would lead to greater revenues and greater shareholder equity.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    Data compilation and organization technology tools are the key to being able to provide these outlined products and services.  There will be a great deal of server space and Python/SQL developer bandwidth initiated in creating infrastructure for these products.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    The sheer scale of the markets outlined above are staggering.  The US Public Credit Market is $46T and growing.  Commercial Real Estate is another $20.7T, and Residential Real Estate is roughy $9.2T.
